## Inspiration
We are a group of 3 people that study engineering (telecommunications and computer), our goal on this event was to learn more about hardware and software so that in furthermore events or work projects our knowledge is more extended and fluent.

## What it does
Our project consists on collecting data of different sensors such as temperature, humidity, sound... and transforming those numbers and code into graphs in order to see more clear the results we are getting.

## How we built it
When we decided what challenge we were going to do, we divided our tasks so that we could be more efficient with the time given. The first thing we did was learn how to use the hardware provided(sensors, chips), software(API, code used) and how to use Grafana. Once we were familiar with those we started collecting data and transforming it into code and graphs and analyzing how it provides us the information.

## Challenges we ran into
The challenges we ran into where learning how to use every sensor that we were going to use and how did it work, then knowing how to use Grafana to get our graphs done with the code we were providing.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Setting up all the hardware we need for our project and accomplishing the creation of graphs with Grafana.

## What we learned
We learned how to use the micro controller ESP32, the functioning of the sensors and how to connect them to the ESP32, make interfaces with ESP32, how to create a API for Grafana and how to use Grafana to make graphs.
